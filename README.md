Project1 is designed to have a better understanding on percepton.
I use simulation to discuss the influence of number of instance and learning rate on the iteration number of times for percepton to converge.
Code shown in PerceptonDemo.py and report shown in Project1.pdf.

Project2 is designed to learn the trade-off between bias and variance.
Code shown in BVDemo.java and report shown in Project2.pdf.
