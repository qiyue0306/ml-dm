Project1 is designed to have a better understanding on perceptron.
I use simulation to discuss the influence of number of instance and learning rate on the iteration number of times for perceptron to converge.
Code shown in PerceptronDemo.py and report shown in Project1.pdf.

Project2 is designed to learn the trade-off between bias and variance.
Code shown in BVDemo.java and report shown in Project2.pdf.
